Title of Dataset: Dissolved Cr concentration and stable isotope data presented in “Release from biogenic particles, benthic fluxes, and deep water circulation control Cr and ?53Cr distributions in the ocean interior” (Janssen et al., 2021, EPSL).

Data Files: Janssen_etal_Incubation1_Zenodo.txt

Treatment: Incubation treatment (initial conditions, ambient incubation temperature, or cold incubation temperature)
Rep: Incubation replicate
Time: Time since start of incubation [hours]
Cr: Total dissolved Cr concentration determined by isotope dilution using double spike methodology [nmol kg-1]
Cr sd: Total dissolved Cr concentration standard deviation (5% RSD where replicates are absent, or 1SD when replicates are present [nmol kg-1]
?53Cr: Dissolved Cr stable isotope composition expressed in delta notation relative to NIST SRM 979 by double spike methodology [‰]
?53Cr 2 SEM: Uncertainty of ?53Cr data, expressed as 2 standard errors of the mean. For individual measurements this is the internal uncertainty and for weighted mean samples it is the uncertainty of the weighted mean [‰]
NOx: Dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
NOx sd: Dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentration standard deviation (1SD of replicates) [µmol kg-1]
PO4: Dissolved phosphate concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
PO4: Dissolved phosphate concentration 1SD of replicates [µmol kg-1]
Si(OH)4: Dissolved silicic acid concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
Si(OH)4 sd: Dissolved silicic acid concentration 1SD of replicates [µmol kg-1]
NH4: Dissolved ammonium concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
NH4 sd: Dissolved ammonium concentration standard deviation (1SD of replicates) [µmol kg-1]
NO2: Dissolved nitrite concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
NO2 sd: Dissolved nitrite concentration standard deviation (1SD of replicates) [µmol kg-1]
