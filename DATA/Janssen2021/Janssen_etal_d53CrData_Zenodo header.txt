Title of Dataset: Dissolved Cr concentration and stable isotope data presented in “Release from biogenic particles, benthic fluxes, and deep water circulation control Cr and ?53Cr distributions in the ocean interior” (Janssen et al., 2021, EPSL).

Data Files: Janssen_etal_d53CrData_Zenodo.txt

Cruise: The cruise on which the samples were collected
Station: Unique station identifier from the cruise
Latitude: The latitude where the rosette cast began [degrees and minutes North]
Longitude: The longitude where the rosette cast began [degrees and minutes East]
Depth: Depth below the surface from which the sample was taken [m]
Potential Temperature: Seawater potential temperature calculated using Ocean Data View from CTD measurements of temperature and pressure [°C]
Salinity: Seawater salinity from CTD
Neutral Density: Seawater neutral density calculated from CTD measurements of depth, temperature and saliniy using Ocean Data View [kg m-3]
Salinity: CTD seawater salinity
O2: Concentration of dissolved oxygen from CTD data [nmol kg-1]
Cr: Total dissolved Cr concentration determined by isotope dilution using double spike methodology [nmol kg-1]
?53Cr: Dissolved Cr stable isotope composition expressed in delta notation relative to NIST SRM 979 by double spike methodology [‰]
2 SEM: Uncertainty of ?53Cr data, expressed as 2 standard errors of the mean. For individual measurements this is the internal uncertainty and for weighted mean samples it is the uncertainty of the weighted mean [‰]
NO3: Dissolved nitrate concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
PO4: Dissolved phosphate concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
Si(OH)4: Dissolved silicic acid concentrations measured by autoanalyzer [µmol kg-1]
Water Mass: Intermediate or deep water mass assigned to the sample based on temperature, salinity, density and location.
