File header

date_time [UTC]: start date and time of the trace metal rosette deployment from which the samples were taken in ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+00:00 [UTC]
latitude [degN]: latitude at which the trace metal rosette deployment began [decimal degrees North]
longitude [degE]: longitude at which the trace metal rosette deployment began [decimal degrees East]
trace_metal_rosette_cast_number: unique identification number of each trace metal rosette cast during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition
ace_event_number: unique identification number of the trace metal rosette deployment within the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition project
ace_sample_number: unique number of the seawater sample within the ACE project in the format shipname/ACE/legnumber/projectnumber/julianday[UTC]/eventnumber/PIinitials/projectsamplenumber
depth [m]: depth below the surface from which the seawater sample was taken [m]
chromium_concentration [nmol/kg]: concentration of chromium (VI and III) measured in the seawater sample, based on a double-spike method [nanomols per kilogram]
d53Cr [‰]: seawater stable chromium isotope composition (Cr VI and III) expressed in delta-notation relative to NIST SRM 979. Based on a double-spike method [‰]
internal_error [‰]: In run error on d53Cr (2 standard error of the mean) [‰]
