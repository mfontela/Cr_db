Seawater chromium concentrations and isotope compositions in the Southern Ocean during the austral summer of 2016/2017, on board the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE).

***** Dataset abstract *****

Dissolved seawater chromium (Cr) concentrations and stable isotope compositions measured on samples collected with a trace metal clean rosette system in the Southern Ocean. Stations TM 7 to TM 12 reflect a north-south transect from Hobart, Tasmania to Mertz Glacier in Antarctica. Stations TM 14 and TM 15 neighbour the Balleny Islands. Stations TM 18 and TM 20 are located in the Drake Passage. Water samples were collected down to a depth of 1000 metres. The water was filtered in a class 100 clean container aboard the ship through pre-rinsed Supor Acropak capsule filters (0.2 um). Subsequently the samples were acidified and stored at a pH < 2 for several months prior to analysis. Reported values therefore represent bulk seawater chromium (Cr III and Cr VI). The data was obtained using the double-spike technique.

***** Original data collection *****

Seawater samples were collected with a trace metal clean rosette system and subsequently filtered and acidified aboard the ship (see above). Back home in the clean lab at the University of Bern an appropriate amount of double-spike (50Cr-54Cr) was added to 1-litre seawater samples prior to chemical processing. Chromium was enriched by co-precipitation with Mg(OH)2 and purified in two subsequent chromatographic steps.

Purified seawater Cr was measured for its isotope composition and concentration on a Neptune™ Series High Resolution Multicollector ICP-MS (Neptune Plus, Thermo Fisher). Prior and between sample analysis an isotope reference material, NIST SRM 979, was measured to confirm correct and stable machine performance. Data precision was assessed by processing 6 seawater samples as replicates through the entire procedure and yielded estimates of the uncertainty of +/-0.036‰ for d53Cr and +/- 2.2% for Cr concentrations (2SD). Data accuracy was confirmed by an inter-comparison with the Saskatchewan Isotope Laboratory.

***** Data processing *****

Chromium isotope compositions of samples were deduced from raw background-corrected intensities on the mass spectrometer (1011 ohm resistors). Data reduction used an R-script following Rudge et al. (2009). R, version 3.2.2 was used. The equations were complemented and include interference corrections for Ti, V and Fe on Cr.

***** Quality checking *****

Quality checking included four key aspects. (1) We monitored the chromium blanks of our chemical procedure, which corresponded to 0.9% of sample-derived Cr on average and did not exceed 1.5%. These blank levels are negligible and no corrections were applied to concentrations and isotope compositions. (2) We assured in each session that the mass-spectrometer yielded the correct Cr isotope composition for Nist SRM 979 and monitored if this value would drift in the session. This was not case. (3) We processed 6 samples as full replicates to establish the precision of the method. (4) We performed an inter-comparison with the Saskatchewan Isotope Laboratory. 

Data precision estimates correspond to +/- 0.036‰ for d53Cr and to +/- 2.2% for Cr concentrations (2SD) as mentioned above. The lab-inter-comparison showed a maximal difference of 0.02‰ in d53Cr and of 2.7% for Cr concentrations for the compared samples indicating that our data is accurate. All reported samples were measured under similar analytical conditions such that the error estimates are representative for all samples.    

***** Standards *****

The isotope data is reported in delta-units relative to Nist SRM 979 (widely used in the literature). 

***** Further information for interpreting the data and using the dataset *****

Timescales: Based on our current understanding, Cr concentrations and isotope compositions are unlikely to change seasonally in the Southern Ocean, neither in the surface ocean (<100 m) nor at greater depth. The time scale of variability is not well constrained at this stage. 

Interpolation: Based on our observations, interpolations of Cr concentrations and isotopes between analysed depths at a station should be fine. Laterally, such interpolations would also seem feasible in the Southern Ocean, although ideally interpolation should be based on the assumption of nearly conservative behaviour of Cr in the water column. Therefore, it could be tied to salinity and other water mass properties. 

Aggregation to a lower temporal resolution: Currently, we have little constraints on temporal variability given that we have not sampled the same stations at different times.
